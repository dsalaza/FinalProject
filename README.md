Baseball Roster Finder

Created by Devon Salazar

Made possible with use of the MLB Data API - https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/

This project fetches assorted information for each member of an MLB team's 40-man roster. The data is current as of the 2022 season.

To use, simply enter the name of the MLB team you wish to see the roster of. Note: do not include the city name. Ex: "Angels" instead of "Los Angeles Angels". The program will retrieve the entire roster's position, throwing hand, and hitting hand. If you would like to mark a particular player as one of your favorites, click "Mark as Favorite".
